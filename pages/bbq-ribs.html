                Fun Fact:  The history of BBQ ribs is as diverse as BBQ itself. It's a path that began in the Caribbean, traveled north by Spanish Conquistadors, moved overseas to the Americas, and then seasoned with flavors of European settlers.

                4 oz piloncillo or brown sugar
            </li>
<br>
            <li>
                1 cup water
            </li>
<br>
            <li>
                1 lime
            </li>
<br>
            <li>
                1/3 cup cider vinegar
            </li>
<br>
            <li>
                1 rack st louis cut pork ribs
            </li>
<br>
            <li>
                1â€“2 tablespoons achiote sauce
            </li>
<br>
            <li>
                1 tablespoon Hardcore Carnivore Red seasoning
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Start by making the pineapple preserve. Trim the top, bottom and skin off the fresh pineapple. Cut lengthways into quarters and remove the core from each piece. Cut lengthways again to get 8 total pieces. Lay them on a lined sheet pan and place into a 400f oven for about 1.5 hours until they are deeply brown. Once baked and cooled, dice the pineapple finely.
                </p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Use a serrated knife to scrape/chop the piloncillo. Add the white sugar, piloncillo and water to a medium saucepan. Place over medium heat and stir until sugar dissolves and starts to bubble. Add the juice of the lime, cider vinegar and chopped pineapple. Reduce heat to a bubbling simmer, then cook until the preserve reduces and thickens, up to an hour. Allow to cool.
                </p>

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Heat a smoker to run between 225-250f. I recommend using cherry or another fruit wood for this recipe.
                </p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p>
                    While the smoker comes to temperature, prepare the ribs. Remove them from plastic (if necessary) and pat dry with a paper towel. Slather them with achiote sauce (use gloves as it can stain), then coat with a generous layer of Hardcore Carnivore Red seasoning.
                </p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Place the racks into the smoker, meat side up. Cook for three hours, they wrap tightly into two layers of foil. Cook a further two hours, meat side down.
                </p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
               <p>
                   After 5 total cooking hours, unwrap the ribs and return them to the smoker, meat side up. Use a spoon to spread a generous amount of the pineapple preserve over the top of the ribs (it should have a shiny but chunky finish) and then cook a further 5-10 minutes to set the preserve. Serve and enjoy!
